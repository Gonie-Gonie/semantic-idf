## Breaking Changes

- _None._

## Added

- Semantic YAML now exposes EnergyPlus compatibility adapter metadata, split ZoneList/SpaceList/ZoneGroup views, zone Spaces, richer output attachment resolution, and expanded HVAC loop metadata.
- Diagnose, Summary, HVAC, and semantic exports now expose source, confidence, and evidence metadata for inferred or analyzer-limited results.

## Changed

- HVAC analysis now treats Branch components as EP26-style 4-field groups by default and includes CondenserLoop, connector/branch rule diagnostics, and ZoneHVAC equipment sequence metadata.
- Summary and HVAC UI views now surface confidence/source badges, grouped diagnostic sources, HVAC component families, and a compact/full semantic YAML toggle.
- The analyzer workspace, HVAC relation view, and simulation graphs now provide denser layout presets, a zone-first relation table, and time-range controls for long SQL/CSV and heat-flow outputs.
- HVAC component family and role labels now distinguish pipes, cooling towers, heat pumps, water heaters, controls, and condenser/plant/air-side context in both semantic exports and the UI.

## Fixed

- _None._
